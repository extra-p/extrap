This is the README for LULESH 2.0 using CUDA

This is meant to be an example of how we would port this type of code to CUDA for Nvidia GPUs.

More information including LULESH 1.0 can be found at https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php

*** Notable changes in LULESH 2.0 using CUDA ***

Split functionality into different files
lulesh.cu - where most (all?) of the timed functionality lies
lulesh-comm.cu - MPI functionality
lulesh-comm-gpu.cu - MPI functionality

The unstructured meshes feature is available but not fully supported.  It will generate incorrect verification output and the report is turned off.
