Extra-P is an automatic performance-modeling tool that supports the user in the identification of *scalability bugs*.
A scalability bug is a part of the program whose scaling behavior is unintentionally poor,
that is, much worse than expected. A performance model is a formula that expresses a performance metric of interest
such as execution time or energy consumption as a function of one or more execution parameters such as the size of the
input problem or the number of processors.

Extra-P uses measurements of various performance metrics at different execution configurations as input to generate
performance models of code regions (including their calling context) as a function of the execution parameters.
All it takes to search for scalability issues even in full-blown codes is to run a manageable number of small-scale
performance experiments, launch Extra-P, and compare the asymptotic or extrapolated performance of the worst instances
to the expectations.

Extra-P generates not only a list of potential scalability bugs but also human-readable models for all
performance metrics available such as floating-point operations or bytes sent by MPI calls that can be further
analyzed and compared to identify the root causes of scalability issues.

The following video on the Laboratory for Parallel Programming @ TUDa [YouTube](
https://www.youtube.com/@parallel_tuda) channel provides a quick introduction to Extra-P.

Extra-P is developed by [TU Darmstadt](https://www.parallel.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) –
in collaboration with [ETH Zurich](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/).

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* numpy
* pycubexr
* marshmallow
* packaging
* tqdm
* kaitaistruct
* protobuf
* itanium_demangler
* sympy
* typing-extensions
* PySide6 (for GUI)
* matplotlib (for GUI)
* pyobjc-framework-Cocoa (only for GUI on macOS)

### Installation

Use the following command to install Extra-P and all required packages via `pip`.

```
python -m pip install extrap --upgrade
``` 

The `--upgrade` forces the installation of a new version if a previous version is already installed.

### Usage

Extra-P can be used in two ways, either using the command-line interface or the graphical user interface. More
information about the usage of Extra-P with both interfaces can be found in
the [quick start guide](docs/quick-start.md).

> **Note**  
> Extra-P is designed for weak-scaling, therefore, directly modeling of strong-scaling behaviour is not supported.
> Instead of modeling the runtime of your strong-scaling experiment, you can model the resource consumption, i.e.,
> the runtime *times* the number of processors. Extra-P automatically offers this conversion, if it detects that
> strong-scaling data was loaded. If you are loading files that contain per-thread/per-rank data you should select
> the scaling-type upfront to run the conversion already during the import.

#### Graphical user interface

The graphical user interface can be started by executing the `extrap-gui` command.

#### Command line interface

The command line interface is available under the `extrap` command:

`extrap` _OPTIONS_ (`--cube` | `--text` | `--talpas` | `--json` | `--extra-p-3` | `--experiment`) _FILEPATH_

You can use different input formats as shown in the examples below:

* Text files: `extrap --text test/data/text/one_parameter_1.txt`
* JSON files: `extrap --json test/data/json/input_1.JSON`
* Talpas files: `extrap --talpas test/data/talpas/talpas_1.txt`
* Create model and save it to text file at the given
  path: `extrap --out test.txt --text test/data/text/one_parameter_1.txt`

  You can find an overview about all command line options
  under [docs/command-line-options.md](docs/command-line-options.md).
